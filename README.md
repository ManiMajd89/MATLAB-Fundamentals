This script covers:
- **Array and Matrix Operations**: Creating and manipulating vectors and matrices.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Performing scalar and element-wise operations.
- **Logical Indexing**: Applying relational and logical operations on data.
- **Programming Constructs**: Examples of loops, conditional statements, and indexing.
- **Data Visualization**: Customizing plots with labels, legends, and styles.
- **Miscellaneous Functions**: Using built-in functions like `size`, `max`, and more.


## Getting Started

To use this project, you need MATLAB installed on your system. Follow these steps:
	1.	Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matlab-basics.git
	2.	Open the matlab_basics.m script in MATLAB.
	3.	Run sections of the script individually to explore the commands and their outputs.

## Script Overview

### Arrays and Matrices
- Row and Column Vectors: Create vectors using square brackets and manage row/column transpositions.
- Matrix Creation: Use built-in functions like rand, ones, zeros, and eye to generate matrices.
- Slicing and Indexing: Access specific elements, rows, columns, or sub-matrices.

### Mathematical Operations
- Perform scalar operations like addition and multiplication.
- Compute square roots, maximum values, and element-wise operations using .* and .^.
- Resize matrices and manipulate their dimensions with functions like size.

### Logical Operations
- Apply relational operators (>, <, ==, ~=) for comparisons.
- Use logical indexing to filter or modify specific elements of vectors or matrices.

### Programming Constructs
- Implement if statements, for loops, and other control flow structures.
- Explore how MATLAB handles loop indices and logical conditions.

### Data Visualization
- Create and customize plots with the plot function.
- Add titles, labels, legends, and modify line styles, colors, and markers.
- Learn to overlay multiple plots using hold on and hold off.

## Usage
