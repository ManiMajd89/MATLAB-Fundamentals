## Getting Started

To use this project, you need MATLAB installed on your system. Follow these steps:
	1.	Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matlab-basics.git
	2.	Open the matlab_basics.m script in MATLAB.
	3.	Run sections of the script individually to explore the commands and their outputs.

## Script Overview

### Arrays and Matrices
	•	Row and Column Vectors: Create vectors using square brackets and manage row/column transpositions.
	•	Matrix Creation: Use built-in functions like rand, ones, zeros, and eye to generate matrices.
	•	Slicing and Indexing: Access specific elements, rows, columns, or sub-matrices.

### Mathematical Operations
	•	Perform scalar operations like addition and multiplication.
	•	Compute square roots, maximum values, and element-wise operations using .* and .^.
	•	Resize matrices and manipulate their dimensions with functions like size.

### Logical Operations
	•	Apply relational operators (>, <, ==, ~=) for comparisons.
	•	Use logical indexing to filter or modify specific elements of vectors or matrices.

### Programming Constructs
	•	Implement if statements, for loops, and other control flow structures.
	•	Explore how MATLAB handles loop indices and logical conditions.

### Data Visualization
	•	Create and customize plots with the plot function.
	•	Add titles, labels, legends, and modify line styles, colors, and markers.
	•	Learn to overlay multiple plots using hold on and hold off.
